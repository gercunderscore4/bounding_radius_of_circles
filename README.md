# bounding_radius_of_circles
A script for some diameter calculations in Octave/MATLAB

Attempts to calculate how tightly a set of circles can be packed into a larger circle.

TODO:
  - Calculate bounding circle more accurately.
  - Add hill-climbing algorithm at end and jitter cicles to attempt to better use remaining space.
  - Add randomization of order of radii and run multiple iterations for better result*.
  - Check literataure for good or optimal mathematical method.

*Code is procedural and generate same outputs given same inputs.
